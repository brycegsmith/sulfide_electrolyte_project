# Sulfide Electrolyte Project

## Overview
This repository contains data analysis code associated with the Sulfide Electrolyte Project for [Dr. Matthew McDowell's laboratory](https://mtmcdowell.gatech.edu/). The main functions of this scripts in this library are:
* Analyze film quality with lightboard image processing tools.
* Extract film ionic conductivity from EIS spectra.
* Display data in an intuitive & informative manner.

## Scripts
* __eis.py__: This script extracts sulfide conductivity from EIS spectra taken with a BioLogic instrument. EIS spectra and conductivity can be compared across processing conditions with plotting tools.
* __film_quality.py__: This script uses image processing to assign a quality score to films using the lightboard technique. Thresholded images and quality scores are exported.

## Development
Scripts in this repository were created by Bryce Smith (Undergraduate Student), David Yeh (Masters Student), John Harris (Graduate Student) for [Dr. Matthew McDowell's laboratory](https://mtmcdowell.gatech.edu/). Contributions are more than welcome so please contact me, open an issue, or submit a pull request!
